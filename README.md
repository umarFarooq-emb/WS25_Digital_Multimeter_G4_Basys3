# Digital Multimeter Project
## Digital Circuit Design MS Electronic Engineering WS25

The already working project contains the top files with the 8 modules to be implemented by 8 group members. As agreed upon we will be working on *One single branch* as the project is not too big.

> It is suggested that we exercise a lot of precaution before commiting and pushing on the main branch and always check the `git diff` with great attention.

## Managing testbenchs for different Modules

- A separate folder for testbenchs named (G4_testbenchs) in the repo is already created.
- After testing the modules please add your testbench in that dedicated folder.
- Please adhere to the naming convention of the *testbench* like `*tb.sv`; the name of the testbench must end with `tb.sv` as this thing is already ignored in the `.gitignore` file and the `testbench` file must be copied in the `G4_testbenchs` folder by the engineer him/her self.

Happy Hacking!!!
